<p>In the past few days, I have been involved in a terrible situation, and found myself in a frightening and uncertain place. I need to speak about it. Someone close to me created a social media account targeting transgender individuals competing in sport - more specifically, several in the Northeast bike racing community. A community that has been my home these past four years. I did not see the account, nor the language that it used, but like other members of this community whom I’ve spoken with in the past forty-eight hours, I’m upset and traumatized. I am so traumatized.</p>

<p>Those specifically targeted by this social media account sought its author by any means necessary, as I would fully expect them to do. They were successful in doing so, and made a logical deduction that I was involved by proxy. I was not involved, but I don’t harbor any illwill towards them for suspecting so. In attempting to cause destruction and pain to transgender athletes, the social media account has caused destruction to my personal life. I am in so much pain.</p> 

<p>But my pain need not be the concern of those affected. You may be curious as to who I am, because I was so close to this event. More than anything in the world right now, I would like to tell you.</p>

<p>Risk is the delight of my life. It explains the bike racing. I’ve become conscious of how to manage it consciously in trying to win bike races. We all determine how much risk we’re willing to accept for ourselves. Making judgments about social groupings is a risk I’ve never had the stomach to take on. I don’t know the attitudes, concerns, and chemistries of each and every person who identifies as transgender to make a judgment on how they should be living their life. I don’t have a judgment on how they should be caring for their pets, how diligent they should be in their dishwashing, or how they should be racing their bike. I’m quite content to let experts on the subject (the bike racing part) work those details out – governing bodies – and I believe them to be competent in doing so.</p>

<p>I will, however, take the risk of stating that I want everyone to have an opportunity to partake of our beloved ritual. Racing bikes is one of the greatest joys a person can possibly experience. Just speaking of it makes me salivate for this weekend in Harvard, Massachusetts. I hope you will say hello if you see me.</p>

<p>When I was a teenaged boy in highschool, I lived a marvelous life. There was lots of eyeliner, wild hairstyles, David Bowie (every period of life for me involves David Bowie), androgynous fashion, and an older boy in the local university with whom I entered into a loving relationship with. Nearly twenty years ago, now, I look back at it as one of the happiest times in my life.</p> 

<p>I’m much older, now - I know this because I eat unflavored oatmeal. But I can remember that time, and wonder if it has anything in common with the transgender experience. Certainly I was bullied and shoved around in school. But I learned that there is infinite potential for happiness and balance when one endeavors to express one’s inner self onto the world. It is the right of everyone to make such an endeavor. I look like a plain old guy now – male-pattern hair loss has seen to that. Our Earthly bodies obey their own laws, rarely listening to what our minds or feelings would prefer them to do. Hair loss is something that can be accepted and lived with, but I understand that for individuals, the option to live with and accept an inconvenient gender is simply not a possibility.</p>

<p>Solitude is perhaps the greatest drug I’ve tasted. I drink it up like honey and don’t want to stop drinking. But through the trauma of this ordeal, I’ve learned how much I’ve starved myself for community in the process. And that there is a community here for me. I am in awe of this gift. <strong>To my friends, new and old, to USA Cycling, to NYSBRA, thank you</strong>. You are everything to me, ever more so as I am writing this.</p>

<p>I don’t know if my limited thoughts and feelings about transgender expression make me an enemy of some women. The Feminine spirit represents some kind of missing component of my being. I don’t know how it was lost in the first place, but I thirst for it like one thirsts for water in the desert. Who else feels like this? Is it only men, or women too? I don’t know, because it isn’t something one generally converses about. Maybe everyone, whether consciously or not, in any number of ways, are looking for it. Because before anything else, including God or the absence thereof, there was the Feminine spirit. This is my belief.</p>

<p>I marvel at those willing to make enemies to further a cause, the way a child marvels at a skyscraper or other great work of labor that they cannot grasp on a gut level. My stomach has never been up to it. That’s why I’m quite happy to spend my time exploring roads on a bicycle instead of taking hard stances on the social issues of our time. Maybe I’ll spend some of that time on the bike thinking about why this is, and if there’s anything I could do about it.</p>

<p>But right now I need rest. I have no appetite and it’s ever so exhausting. My door is open if you wish to <a href="/is-listening">contact me</a>. I will endeavor with all of my being to keep the door open.</p>
